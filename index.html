                            <p id="about-paragraph">Hello, I am Ryan, a recent graduate of the Thinkful Software Engineering course. I've been interested in computers since I was very young and first got my hands on a "Macintosh II" in a computers summer camp, because I was the kid that wanted to go to computer camp. Forget camping. After over a decade in retail and retail management I'm finally doing something that I really enjoy, and hope to combine my experience with my passion for programming to excel in the modern team based development environment.

                    <p>This is a simple quiz web application showcasing HTML CSS Javascript and in particular Jquery.</p>
                    <p>It was my first from-scratch project in Thinkful's Software Engineering program and prompts the user with a series of questions and gives feedback from each one. At the conclusion of the quiz the user is shown their score and asked if they would like to play again. 
                    It's good for anyone looking for a basic biology refresher.

                    <p>This is the API Hack capstone project for Thinkul's Nights and Weekends software engineering course.

                    <p>The App is designed with people who have recently damaged their smartphones in mind. The user enters the 
                        smartphone model and zip code and they are shown a list of youtube videos that demonstrate 
                        the repair for the DIY'er as well as a map of their area with markers and list for local repair shops If they are less bold.
